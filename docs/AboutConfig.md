# About Config Read Me

The seis-automation-box currently has two configuration files: Essential Info and Option Inst. This toolbox doesn't store or transmit any of your information. It's open source, so you can review its code and even build it yourself.

Before running the executable, please update the contents of the config files to reflect your own settings.
